# Elkhorn Slough: Public Repository 

This contains the code used for the analysis of water quality data in the Elkhorn Slough. The data are only available on our private Github (I have an SSH key available in case access is needed). 

We focus on five sites: North Marsh, Upper and Middle Azevedo, East Bennett, and Moro Cojo. All sites are tidally restricted, and are more likely for us to be able to pick up correlations between water quality and land use/management practices. 

Much of the code is derived from code provided to us from Kathleen Hicks, in preparation for her Masters thesis.
